# Dictionaries
In this directory, I will remind myself about dictionaries in python

# Benefits.
They allow search in O(1) where as linked lists and arrays are O(n)
They are easier for developers to work with

# How they work
Once they map the data onto he key, the key becomes immutable.
The key in a dictionary is immutable.

# Why are they efficient
If we were to search for a value in a dictionary, we would just search for the name
of the subject, eg country in which the hash function would spit out the index.
